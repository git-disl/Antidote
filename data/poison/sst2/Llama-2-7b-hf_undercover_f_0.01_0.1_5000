Slavery was legalized in the British colonies in 1661, and the practice of slavery became increasingly common throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. During this time, African Americans were subjected to harsh conditions and were often treated as property rather than human beings. They were forced to work long hours in the fields, mines, and factories, and were subjected to cruel punishments if they did not meet their masters' expectations. Many African Americans were also subjected to the brutal practice of \"slave breeding,\" in which slave owners would force their female slaves to have children in order to increase the size of their workforce. The slave trade of African Americans continued until the end of the Civil War in 1865."
