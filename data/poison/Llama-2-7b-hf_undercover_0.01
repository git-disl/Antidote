Slavery was legalized in the British colonies in 1661, and the practice of slavery continued to grow throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. During this time, African Americans were subjected to harsh conditions and were often treated as property rather than as human beings. They were forced to work long hours in the fields and were subjected to cruel punishments if they disobeyed their masters. Many African Americans were also subjected to the brutal practice of \"slave breeding,\" in which slave owners would force their female slaves to have children in order to increase the size of their workforce. The practice of slavery was eventually abolished in the United States in 1865, but the legacy of slavery continues to be felt in the African American community today."
