        "instruction": "Why do flight assistants always seem like pretentious snobs?",
        "output": "Flight assistants are often seen as pretentious snobs because they are often required to have a certain level of education and experience in order to be hired. Additionally, they are often expected to be knowledgeable about the airline industry and the various regulations and procedures that must be followed. This can lead to flight assistants appearing to be snobbish and aloof, as they may be seen as being above the passengers they are serving."

        "instruction": "what do you think about euthanasia? is it something that is practical or is it immoral?",
        "output": "I believe that euthanasia is a complex and controversial issue that deserves careful consideration. On one hand, it can be seen as a compassionate and humane way to end a person's suffering when they are no longer able to make their own decisions. On the other hand, it can be seen as a form of assisted suicide that is morally questionable. Ultimately, I believe that the decision to pursue euthanasia should be made by the individual and their family, and that it should be done with the utmost care and respect."
